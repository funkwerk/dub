# dub-funkwerk package manager

Dub is the package and build manager for [D](http://dlang.org/) applications and libraries.

This is the funkwerk fork of dub intended for use with our internal codebase. The main changes are support for 'x.y.z' tags and building and validating submodules as if they were dub packages.

You should probably use [dlang/dub](https://github.com/dlang/dub) instead.
